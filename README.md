# Image Denoising
## Overview
The denoising method was developed based on EDSR [Paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/papers/Lim_Enhanced_Deep_Residual_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf), an advanced super-resolution method. I found it could outperform other network architecture such as DnCNN, U-net, Densenet and RCAN in the case of image denoising.

This code borrows heavily from [pytorch-RCAN-and-EDSR](https://github.com/yulunzhang/RCAN) and [DnCNN](https://github.com/cszn/DnCNN).
